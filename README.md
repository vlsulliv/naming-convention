# Naming-Convention

Naming convention is a framework for naming personal files and folders to make them easier to organize. It aims to provide a consistent file structure that makes files easy to locate while maximizing file portability. </br>

File portability ensures your files can be moved/opened in different operating systems without needing to adjust your file naming structure; this is achieved by using names that observe OS-specific syntax rules.</br>

Use this guide as a base to decide on what works best for you!

## Technical Restrictions

list of technical conventions and restrictions chosen to maximize portability include:
- [linux/unix: rules for file and directory names](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linuxunix-rules-for-naming-file-and-directory-names/)

## Folder Names

## File Names

- no special characters (ex: `*` `.` `”` `/` `\` `[` `]` `:` `;` `|` `=` `,` `<` `?` `>` `$` `#` `!` `‘` `(` `)` `{` `}`).
- use "and" rather than an ampersand unless you’re referencing a brand name (ex: `Procter & Gamble`).
- snake case: will be used for all directory names (ex: `name_pattern`).
- kebab case: will be used for all file names (ex: `name-pattern`).
- directory and file names are written in lowercase letters.
- words are separated by a hyphen (`-`).
- maximum length (with pathname) of 256 characters.
- date standard formats, [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (e.g. timestamp with `YYYYMMDD`).
- sequential numbers: increment with leading zeros (ex: `001`,  `002`,  `003`)
- versioning: use `v01`, `v02`, `v03`
