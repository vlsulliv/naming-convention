## Background

file names are unique entities that identify the its location in a file system. The naming convention is meant to be a systematic method for naming files to make them easier organize. There are OS-specific syntax rules to consider for name specifications.

## Names

- Use "and" rather than an ampersand unless you’re referencing a brand name, for example: Procter & Gamble.

- no special signs (e.g., * . ” / \ [ ] : ; | = , < ? > & $ # ! ‘( ) { })
- names are written in lowercase letters.
- words are separated by a hyphen (-).
- maximum length (with pathname) of 256 characters
- date standard formats, [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (e.g. timestamp with YYYYMMDD)
- kebab case: will be used for all file names (ex: auto-clear-mocks)
- pascal Case: will be used for all directory names (ex: TestNamePattern)
- increment with zeros (ex: 001,  002,  003)
