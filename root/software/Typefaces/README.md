# Typefaces

> A **typeface** is the overall design of lettering

- Also known as "*Font Families*"

- A **Font** is a particular size, weight and style of a typeface.



**PLEASE NOTE:**

This is for digital typefaces. There are *analog* typefaces as well, that are often categorized as images/glyphs. So if you want to preseve typefaces as a whole, maybe add them at the root level instead.
