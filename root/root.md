# root

The root folder is the top folder that contains all folders and files. In this project, root is used as a placeholder name - give this folder an appropriate name. ex: `my-files`, `documents`, if placing on an external drive `f:\some-file-name`.

Files are categorized and sorted into 8 top categories. An additional category 'workspace' or 'collections' can be included for directories or projects that contain related files of different type/extension.

>NOTE: if these files are stored on a external storage system. the root directory is used to identify it as the top directory in the tree but is not related to the root directory root directory (c:) on the OS.
